# COGS118A Project template
# Group021-SP23

Welcome to the repository for Group021 of COGS118A for the Spring 2023 semester. This repository contains all the resources, code, and data related to our final project, which focuses on the exploration and analysis of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Project Overview

Our project aims to identify and address key problems in the functionality and interactions of NLP systems. We are particularly interested in understanding the limitations and potential areas of improvement, especially in terms of handling offensive language and hate speech.

## Dataset

We are using the "Hate Speech and Offensive Language Dataset" from Kaggle, which comprises Twitter data classified into three categories: hate speech, offensive language, and neither. This dataset will help us understand how well NLP systems can handle and moderate offensive content.
