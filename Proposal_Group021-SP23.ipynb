    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",

    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem we are solving is the classification of Tweets into 3 different categories: hate speech, offensive language, or neither. We want to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict a novel tweets class for possible use in automatically moderating the site. One of the more complex parts of creating such a model is turning text into quantitative data. While this is far from impossible, there are many natural language processing techniques we can utilize which can maintain varying amounts of semantic information. After tokenizing a tweet, we can use a Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) strategy to generate a value of how important each word is to a tweet. This is quite a powerful technique because not all offensive tweets are hateful. For example, “I f***ing love this movie” would obviously be flagged for offensive language, but the importance of the offensive word is low and could signify non-hateful meaning. On the other hand, hateful language doesn’t necessarily have to have offensive content, ex. “I think the director of this movie should never show their face in public after that terrible movie”. The main error metric we want to use is false positive rate. As this would be an automatic moderating system, we want to only allow it to ban users only when it is very sure that their tweets are offensive or hateful. We can use a more lenient system for flagging tweets for human moderation where our model might miss, but it would not be good for it to accidentally ban users that did not post malicious content. Malicious text content on the internet is arguably some of the most replicable data there can be. There is a constant flow of tweets being published, and even when they are not neatly organized in a dataset, we can always utilize Twitter’s API to scrape for more data."

Firstly, if the classifier were to perform inaccurately it can cause harm to many people. For example, if it classifies a tweet that is not hateful as hateful, then it can impede on someone's freedom of speech. Second, if it classifies a tweet that is hateful that is not hateful, it can damage a person's mental wellbeing. Our team plans to prioritize reducing misses over false alarms in order to protect the mental health of the users at scale. Contrastingly, because the tweets are posted to the public we are not concerned with privacy issues."
